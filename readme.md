## WattRank tool collects data on all types of energy storage technologies - batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries etc., and creates plots that compare their performance. It features volumetric vs gravimetric energy plots as well as custom plots that can be used in papers.

### Gather scattered data

When one looks at parameters of an energy storage device or measurement results, the numbers alone don’t give the answer to the crucial question ‘Is it good?’. We can only figure that out if placed against the competition. However, the data used for the energy comparison plots is usually outdated, incomplete, and hard to find. The same applies to other performance comparison plots found in research papers, such as Ragone plots, cycle life vs energy, etc.

WattRank was created with the mission to provide a practical and easy-to-use tool for scientists/batteries enthusiasts/reporters/investors etc., where they can find up-to-date data on all energy storage technologies. I hope it will help standardize and improve the quality of performance comparison plots used in research papers and analytical reports, as well as will be a great database for future studies.

### Share data and use the plots in your research paper or blog post

The most important thing about this project is to have a community of people, who will be happy to share their data with others. The data on full cell measurements is incredibly hard to gather. There is no single repository - it is scattered in research papers, product data sheets, company announcements, etc. Additionally, there are no standards on what information has to be given with measurement results and in what format they should be. Recently, some publishers introduced checklists to improve the quality of data, and a proposition of Battery Data Genome was presented. However, even if from now on it would be widely introduced, older publications didn’t follow those rules. 

This is why, I invite all researchers and enthusiasts to share their data - both from older publications and from the ones you are working on now. Adding your measurement results will show you exactly, where the studied material lands in the broad scope of all technologies, chemistries, etc. And the newly generated plot would be immediately ready-to-use in your next paper!

### Some technical details

The data presented here only includes commercial devices or research papers with full cell measurements. No half-cell data is considered.
