## WattRank tool collects data on all types of energy storage technologies - batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries etc., and creates plots that compare their performance.

### Motivation

In order to accurately assess the performance of an energy storage device we need to make a comparison with its counterparts. However, it can be difficult to find complete and up-to-date data for these comparisons, such as energy plots, cycle life, or Ragone plots.

WattRank was created with the goal of creating a user-friendly resource for scientists, battery enthusiasts, reporters, investors, and others to find current data on all types of energy storage technologies. I hope, that this tool will help to standardize and improve the quality of performance comparison plots used in research papers and reports and serve as a valuable database for future studies.

### Share data and use the plots in your research paper, report, blog etc.

The key to making this project a success is getting a community of people together who are willing to share their data with others. The data on full cell measurements is incredibly hard to gather. There is no single repository - it is scattered in research papers, product data sheets, manufacturers’ announcements, etc. Additionally, there are no standards on test conditions and parameters, what information should be included with measurement results and in what format they should be. Recently, some publishers introduced checklists to improve the quality of data, and a proposition of Battery Data Genome was presented. But these things haven't been widely adopted yet, and lots of older publications don't follow these guidelines.

This is why I invite all researchers and enthusiasts to share their data, whether it's from older publications or current projects. Adding your measurement results will show you exactly, where your material fits in the broad scope of technologies and chemistries out there. And the newly generated plot will be ready to use in your next paper right away!

### Some technical details

WattRank only includes research papers with full-cell measurement data and data from commercial devices. No half-cell data is considered.

More details coming soon…
